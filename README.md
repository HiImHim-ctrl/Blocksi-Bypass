A website for bypassing system monitoring and restricting tools such as Blocksi which my school uses

i forked this with slight mods from T-crack by 

* [ ] Make a static HTML file version
* [ ] Find a way to Fullscreen in cloaked mode
* [ ] Add a text-chat room (other than discord, i'm planning on making my own)
* [ ] Offer multiple methods of bypassing security systems so the user can simply select which one they need to use
* [ ] Make a javascript-void version
* [ ] Add more Domain names for people to use
* [x] Panic button to switch tabs easily
